    Drissa, I can hardly say enough about this doeling. She is a very flashy doe
    that is strong in general appearance. She has amazing rib spacing. She is
    strong in feet and legs, and is long and deep bodied. She is always a joy to
    work with as well.

    Sorella is a very strong doe. She is thick through the shoulders, and has a
    very wide rump. She has become a very well balanced doe, during her second
    year! She is always the first to the milk stand. She has such a sweet
    personality to go with her, easily one of people's favorites when they meet
    the herd.

    I was very excited the day Olivia joined the herd. She is a long bodied
    doe, who I am excited to see freshen. She will be remaining a dry yearling for
    2020.

    Olivia is a very sweet doe and steals the hearts of everyone who meets
    her (even those who do not like goats).
